# Installation

## Requirements

You will need:

 - Node.JS (Latest LTS is recommended)
 - A Package Manager (`yarn` or `npm`)
 - Rollup CLI (Optional, install via `npm install -g rollup`)

## Installing `npm` modules

Run the following the command to install the required packages and TypeScript declaration files:

```bash
npm install
```

Or if you're running `yarn`:

```bash
yarn
```

Once that's all done, let's [authenticate with the Screeps server](./authenticating.md).
